"For an official parade, the PAF (French Air Force aerobatic team) is patrolling in a holding pattern {A} km away from a town square. The objective is to fly over the square at exactly the same time as the foot soldiers during the official parade. The soldiers walk at a speed of {B} m/s and take {C} minutes to reach the square. The Alphajets fly at {D} m/min. How long after the foot patrol starts should the PAF planes leave their holding area to arrive exactly at the same time as the infantrymen on the square?",{A}*1000;{D}/60;{C}*60;{E}/{F}; {H}-{G},"{A}:(20,100,10);{B}:(1,2,1);{C}:(10,40,5);{D}:(3000,5000,500)","To ensure the PAF planes and the foot soldiers arrive at the town square at the same time, we calculate the time needed for each group using the provided variables and then find the difference in start times. 

First, convert the distance for the PAF planes to meters ({A} km to meters) and their speed to meters per second ({D} m/min to m/s). The soldiers' travel time is already given in minutes ({C} minutes), which we convert to seconds.

The distance the soldiers cover is calculated by multiplying their speed ({B} m/s) by their travel time ({C} minutes converted to seconds). For the planes, their travel time to cover the distance {A} km is found by dividing the distance in meters by their speed in m/s.

Finally, the difference in start times (\(\Delta T\)) required for the planes is the difference between the planes' travel time and the soldiers' travel time. This ensures both arrive at the square simultaneously.",1:[{I}]; [{I}/10];[{I}/100];[{I}/2],None
